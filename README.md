Android app for tracking the daily and monthly expenses

This app is developed using phonegap, cordova and jquery mobile. This is my first attempt to create an android app.
The app is used to track my day to day expenses. Each expense made can be categorized based on type (groceries, travel, food etc) and quantity of the item bought.

Going further want to get the consolidated view of expenses that is per month based on categories.
